# Team-Profile-Generator


## About the Project
As a manager, I wanted to be able to create an application that generates and displays my team members information to give me quick access to their emails and github accounts.
This application runs in the terminal and uses nodeJs inquirer to prompt users for their team members information. This application then returns the team members information on an html page and is saved into a folder/


![](/)

### Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Node.js

## Usage
Run node index.js from the command line to start the application(make sure you do an 'nmp install' first to install inquirer). You will then be asked to answer a few questions about your team. After you select the "finish building my team option, an index.html file be created in the dist folder that displays your team members information.
